Credit risk analysis is a crucial task for financial institutions as it enables them to determine the likelihood of default for potential borrowers. In this project, we analyze credit risk using logistic regression and other machine learning models on the American Express dataset. Our aim is to identify the best performing model in predicting credit card defaults and to determine the most important variables in credit risk analysis. Our study shows that XGBoost is the best performing model, with an accuracy of 0.97, precision of 0.91, F1-score of 0.91, AUC value of 0.92. Logistic Regression and other models also performed well, but not as well as XGBoost. Our findings indicate that the most significant variables in predicting credit card defaults are credit score, credit limit utilization, and number of days employed. Furthermore, we find that the age of the borrower is not a significant factor in predicting credit card defaults. This highlights the importance of considering other variables when analyzing credit risk. Our study provides practical implications for financial institutions in improving their credit risk analysis models. By using machine learning techniques such as XGBoost, they can better identify and manage credit risk, thus reducing their losses due to defaults.# Credit_Card_Risk_Analysis
