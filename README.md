Evaluating credit risk is essential for financial institutions to predict potential borrower defaults. In this project, we applied logistic regression and various machine learning models to the American Express dataset to identify the most effective model for predicting credit card defaults. XGBoost emerged as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.97, precision of 0.91, F1-score of 0.91, and AUC of 0.92. Key predictive variables included credit score, credit limit utilization, and employment duration, while the age of the borrower was less significant. Our findings suggest that leveraging machine learning techniques like XGBoost can significantly improve credit risk analysis, helping financial institutions better manage and mitigate default risks.
